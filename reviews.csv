"1679501038-6","2","Reviewed February 7, 2020 Horrible food and serviceTLDR; their food causes stomach upsets, the service at Junction is terrible and the portions are worse.

I've been ordering from these guys for sometime. Over the last few times every time I ordered from their Hurligham branch, I always end up with a stomach...ache the next day. So I decided to order from Junction, the first time went OK, no stomach aches the portions were OK. Yesterday, I ordered from the Junction again, the food was cold- no freezing, the portions were not worth it and now everybody who had the food has a stomach ache.More <img src=""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/d4/a7/1e/this-is-the-crunch-burger.jpg""  class=""centeredImg noscript"" style="" min-width:70px; "" width=""100%""data-mediaid=""450144030"" /> >Date of visit: February 2020Helpful?1  This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

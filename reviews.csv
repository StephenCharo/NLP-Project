I've been ordering from these guys for sometime. Over the last few times every time I ordered from their Hurligham branch, I always end up with a stomach...ache the next day. So I decided to order from Junction, the first time went OK, no stomach aches the portions were OK. Yesterday, I ordered from the Junction again, the food was cold- no freezing, the portions were not worth it and now everybody who had the food has a stomach ache.More <img src=""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/d4/a7/1e/this-is-the-crunch-burger.jpg""  class=""centeredImg noscript"" style="" min-width:70px; "" width=""100%""data-mediaid=""450144030"" /> >Date of visit: February 2020Helpful?1  This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
